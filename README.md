# Policy Innovation Lab Playbook
This is a repository for Carnegie Mellon University's Policy Innovation Lab Playbook. This playbook was designed to provide both students of the lab with guidelines, tips, and strategies for success during the course.

The core of these plays were originally developed by the first class during a workshop held on May 1st, 2019.  Participants reviewed plays, developed themes and highlighted leading lessons learned from the course.  See the credits for the list of CMU students who participated in and helped write and develop these plays. 

These plays are edited and continually revised by each subsequent class.  The Fall 2020 version of the playbook can be downloaded here. 


# Quotes from students (Spring '19)
"I think that anyone who is really interested in federal government consulting should take this class" - Jana L.

"This is a great pre-systems class. But even if you've taken systems this is a great class for anyone interested in applying principles of innovation to government and public services." - Gilbert R.

“Policy Innovation Lab is all about getting comfortable with being uncomfortable. The ambiguity of some aspects of PIL will push students to be self-starters, take initiative, and flex communication skills. Immersing oneself in the agile environment for policy design will demand and strengthen your creative thinking, flexibility, and willingness to fail.” - Alex K.

"This class lays a solid grounding for first-year students who have not yet had a project-based course. The skills developed in this class are applicable to other team-based projects in Heinz courses and for the Systems requirement later on." - Diana R.

“This course offered real world experience in consulting and dealing with clients unlike most other courses. Even the frustrating moments were teaching moments.” - Peter H.
