							<b>Needs are verbs; solutions are nouns.</b><br><br>
                                
							As you review a project brief for Policy Innovation Lab, start with trying to understand what the end users need. If you think about these needs as verbs instead of nouns. Consider, "I need to escape the rain," instead of "I need an umbrella. This seemingly small shift in questioning will open up the realm of possibilities that you and your team can create solutions around to serve real needs.<br><br>
								
							New ways of working, especially those that use human-centered design can feel unfamiliar, uncomfortable, and occasionally disjointed from the conversations and tasks you had just discussed. Lean into it. Human-centered design and agile require a shift in mindset. Students may need to change focus after talking to project stakeholders and confirm different needs. That's ok. Reframing the original problem can not only lead to identifying the real issue, but also result in work that is more nimblenimbler and uses resources more efficiently, effectively, and true to the partner’s constraints. <br><br>

                                <b>Frame the problem you're trying to solve through the point of view of the users.</b><br><br>
                                
								For you and your partners this means putting yourself in the shoes of the end users when reviewing the initial brief for the course. Focus on the problem you are trying to solve and avoid solutionizingsolutioning. Instead, try to, as clearly as possible with the often limitedoften-limited information available, identify the real, underlying problem. Having a user-centric mindset will get you on the same page as your team and ultimately create Most Viable Products (MVPs) that have greater impact.<br><br>
								
								Avoid commitment to the idea you had in week one. Your first good idea is only as valuable and viable in week four as the context and user research you gathered highlights the real problem and potential solution you have iterated in that same week.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>Be open to user research.</b><br><br>
                                
                                User research activities like interviewing and prototype testing are integral to practice human-centered design. As you develop relationships and value pathways with your PIL partners, ask to be connected with various stakeholders and if it would be OK for students to reach out during the semester. User research ca not only lead to greater impact, but also open networks between institutions and partners, partners and students, and a new generation of public policy professionals with organizations seeking a new class of innovators.</p>

                                Your project will probably change over time with the information you learn. Be sure to keep your partner in the loop as it does and verify your findings within their specific context. This sets clear expectations for both parties, andparties and allows you to incorporate their feedback in every iteration. Surprising them at the end, no matter how your team feels about the deliverable, with a product they do not want or need kills implementation.<br><br>

                                Your partner is likely asking you to create something that they can then take to distribute to a third party. Understand that your partner may not actually know exactly what the end user is looking for. Push to talk to end users and understand their needs. Partners ultimately want to deliver something with utility, and so it’s in your best interest to really make something users will benefit from while communicating value to your partner.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>Dedicate one main partner contact.</b><br><br>
                                
                                This will usually be the PM, but it’s important to have one group member be the partner contact for the entire group. This streamlines partner communication and cuts down on confusion, redundancy, and partner annoyance (this can happen if the partner is getting multiple emails from multiple people telling them the same thing, or worse, different things!).</p>

								<i>Be realistic about what you can complete in the time frame that will be most impactful and get partner feedback. Keep your final deliverable in mind as you scope as you work. Keep a master document that has all the information and waypoints reached so you can pass off an organized document of what was accomplished and what is left for the partner to do.</i><br><br>

                                There’s a saying that programmers use – think global program locally. In other words, keep you vision big and keep it in front of you. Prototypes small and lightweight, often most appropriate given the time constraints. Prototyping is a means to get people talking about what they need. A prototype triggers a richer discussion than possible when simply talking about an idea. Let your insights from interviewing people take the lead and guide you into promising directions, keeping you nimble and focused on the end user experience.

								<i>Keep prototyping and prepare partner facing documents to shorten the steps of those implementing solutions and those who challenge your assumptions with new information. Know from the beginning that all your materials and organizing channels are going to be available to professors, partners, and in many cases, the public.

								<i>Though sometimes roles make people feel like they’re pigeonholed into doing one type of work, they’re incredibly important for delegation and assigning responsibility. It’s simply more efficient. This doesn’t mean that that person has to do all the heavy lifting of that role (the Research lead doesn’t have to do all the research). Instead they are responsible for making sure the work is delivered on time every week. On the flip side, roles don’t mean you are free to turn down other types of work that don’t fall into your “lane.” Everyone should be an individual contributor for an even number of tasks.</i><br><br>

								<i>Makes sure that your group sits down as soon as possible and establish who will do what; you will want a project manager at the very least. This will help everyone focus on what their strengths are and make sure that no one is duplicating efforts. It also helps team moral as everyone will know what they need to do.</i><br><br>

								<i>Remember that things tend to get busy in waves at CMU and each team member may not be able to contribute substantially each week. Plan for this reality so that it doesn't impede your group's progress. Team members should communicate openly about their expected contributions and do their best to pick up slack when they have time</i><br><br>

                                <b>What’s your superpower?</b><br><br>
                                
                                Before you ‘define roles’, consider going around the table and asking, “What is your superpower?” “What do you want to learn out of this course?” You never know if someone is a pro at Adobe photoshop or has rich experience talking to clients until you ask them. Role titles are a better fit if it’s a match with that person’s skillset and interest.

								Before you start working, consider going around the table and asking, “What’s your audacious goal for changing policy?” Find out what people’s dreams are. Because this course is about setting a bold vision and seeing how far you can get. Who is to say your vision can’t be something bold like “double voter turnout in presidential elections by 2030”? What if you do discover something incredible and becomes bigger than you ever could have imagined.<br><br>

								<b>Assign "owners" of deliverables and stick to them</b><br><br>

								<b>Assign work to individuals and set intermittent deadlines.</b><br><br>
                                
								Clear tasks and deadlines for individuals can make the process more organized, especially for large groups. You can also avoid situations where tasks are not completed until the last minute or not at all because there was no clear owner.<br><br>

								<b>Establish accountability</b><br><br>
                                
								Summary: Developing and ensuring continued trust among team members is essential. A well-established team structure, no matter the size, is crucial for effective collaboration. This does not necessarily need to be specific roles for everyone but encouraging cross-functionality while outlining certain responsibilities will foster a more rewarding experience.<br><br>

								<b>Maintain reasonably frequent communication with other team members</b><br><br>
                                
								Between other obligations and busy schedules, try to touch base with other team members frequently outside of class to ensure you are not recreating work or miscommunicating. This will ensure you are ready to speak with your partner or share updates when asked in class.<br><br>

Make sure you measure progress and the steps in the process that map out deliverable dates to ensure you are meeting them. Continue to check syllabus and work with professors and partners to set a schedule that works for your so you can meet expectations and timeline.

							<b>Learn to pivot.</b><br><br>

							There's inevitably going to be a partner meeting or interview or article that you read that makes you think you're trending in the wrong direction. This can happen even up to the last week. But it's okay to pivot (strategically) as you go. All the work you did wasn't for not. Dead ends and failures are valuable, utilize them.<br><br>

							<b>Be flexible and comfortable with change.</b><br><br>

							As you continue to develop your project and engage in user research, what you thought you had in mind of your end deliverable will constantly evolve and change - and this is OK! It can be uncomfortable when dealing with time constraints from other courses and commitments, but often you and your partner are in untreaded waters. Lean into the possible, andpossible and know that your work is novel.<br><br>

							<b>Be comfortable with change, even if it means starting over.</b><br><br>

							The initial understanding of the project can change quickly, either through interactions with the partner or through user interviews. Be prepared to adapt your materials to meet new needs. All progress is good progress and will help create a strong product in the end.<br><br>

Synthesize your findings and leverage them to inform your design decisions. While the agile mindset helps you “build the thing right,” users empower you to “build the right thing.”</i><br><br>

							<b>Keep testing and interviewing.</b><br><br>

							<i>It's never too late to do a user interview. The class length is short, and some interviewees may not reveal themselves until the end. Even if they do not directly impact the direction of your project, the information gained will still be valuable for the partner and could influence the next stages. That user may become the an engaged stakeholder in the next step.</i><br><br>

							<b>More often than not, projects will be non-linear. Keep moving forward.</b><br><br>

							<i>Each time you receive more information use this as a chance to enhance or potentially recreate your product. Learning more from your partner, users, and experts will help shape how you continue your work, even if this means pivoting to a new direction.</i><br><br>

							<b>Encourage teams, users, and facilitators to keep more options on the table.</b><br><br>

							<i>Often project teams, partners, and other stakeholders get entrenched in their respective ideas of what the ultimate outcome should be. Being able to reconcile “ideal outcomes” with prototypes and MVPs throughout the agile process is essential for success. Tons of research exists on the value of assessing multiple alternatives before making decisions. If all invested parties can consider more options throughout the duration of the project, collaborative output will likely be more productive and of higher quality and greater context to local constraints.</i><br><br>

							<b>Follow the problem where it goes</b><br><br>

							<i>Your initial hypothesis is going to be wrong the moment you talk to a user. Our first guess about why a problem is happening and what could solve it is usually wrong. This is because people are complex, and they make decisions in random and unique ways. The users are going to give you insights that come from unexpected places. If you think you’ve found something interesting, you have. Dig deeper and learn more about it. If you think the user research does not support your idea, then pivot. Or think of another angle to approach your questions. People are interesting and they will always reveal, directly or indirectly, something valuable to learn.</i><br><br>
